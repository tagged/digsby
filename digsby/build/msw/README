building Digsby dependencies on Windows
=======================================

Known Issues
------------

MSVC9: python/pcbuild/pcbuild.sln is not msvc9 express compatible, fails
       need to script "vcbuild /upgrade pcbuild.sln" process

Prerequisites
-------------

- Visual Studio 2008
- Windows 7 SDK (first google result; you can leave .NET components unchecked in the installer)
  - make sure to run the "Windows SDK Configuration Tool" and set the latest version as active
- Python 2.6 (installed to C:\python26)
 - http://python.org/download/
- perl (ActiveState Perl is easy to install)
 - http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/
- svn (command-line binaries)
 - http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8100
- swig
- git (msys-git, in c:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe)
 - http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
   - your public key needs to be stored in mini:/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys2
     (ssh-keygen can create an ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file for you that git will use
     automatically)
   - Make sure to choose "leave line endings as they are" when installing. If you
     didn't, open Git Bash and run the following command to prevent problems:
       git config --global core.autocrlf false
   - make sure to run these commands to get your username/email configured
     so that if you need to push commits back they have your name.
        git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
        git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
- bakefile
 - http://www.bakefile.org/download.html
- for building CGUI:
 - need boost: unzip http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.42.0/ somewhere and set BOOST_DIR to that directory.

Bootstrapped
------------

- svn (command-line binaries)
 - http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8100
- nasm.exe
 - required by OpenSSL build process
 - binaries at sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6208&package_id=47034
- for building webkit, a cygwin install from http://webkit.org/building/tools.html


Instructions
------------

Get Digsby:
  svn co http://DIGSBYSVN/digsby/trunk digsby

Build all dependencies:
  cd digsby\build\msw
  python build_all.py

To run:
  cd ..\.. (back into the root Digsby directory)
  digsby.bat

git fails w/ FAT32

lxml must be built after PIL (needs zlib) which must come after webkit (needs jpeg)
